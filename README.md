Examples of digital communication components and systems using GNU Radio.

In many universities using Matlab/Simulink is the "de facto" way to learn and simulate digital communication system and components, but around the world most of the current and former students as well as enthusiastic self learners do not have access to the pricy licensed software on ther own computers.
GNU Radio is an excellent alternative for those who are interested in learn, simulate, develope and even implement digital communication systems.

This repository is intended to be a starting point in GNU Radio and hardware implementation of digital communciation systems.
